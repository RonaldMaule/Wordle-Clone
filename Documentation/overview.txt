We have a program which randomly selects a word. It then gives the user 6 guesses to guess the word. If they guess a letter right in the wrong place it
gives a one. If they guess the correct place and letter it gives a 2. If it is the wrong letter and sybmbol it outputs a 0.

The main function should have a loop to play the game when the player starts the program. It tells the player how to play and then when the player presses
enter it chooses a word. It then tells the player to guess the word. The player makes a guess and it displays the guess along with the numbers for each letter.

The player gets up to 6 guesses to guess the word corretly. After each guess the program displays all previous guesses and their numbers. When the player guesses
correctly the program tells them they won and asks if they want to play again. If the player makes 6 guesses and doesn't get it the program tells them the word
and asks if they want to play again.

The last twenty words to be used will be stored in a text file so repeats are less frequent
